# Dashhboard-in-Power-BI
 Power BI is a powerful data visualization and business analytics tool developed by Microsoft. It allows users to create interactive and visually appealing dashboards that provide insights into their data. 

 I created a dashboard of dataset given. It is a survey given by people of differnet country about their career and various other things.

 First I cleaned the dataset in Power BI and then created many visualizations of it.
